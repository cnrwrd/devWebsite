 The <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_Dogs_Act_1991">"Dangerous Dogs Act"</a></b> was introduced in the UK in 1991 and later amended in 1997. It was a reaction to eleven attacks in 1991 and sought to decrease the number of attacks by dogs in the UK. It applies to four types of dogs; the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pit_Bull_Terrier">Pit Bull Terrier</a></b>, the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosa_(dog)">Japanese Tosa</a></b>, the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogo_Argentino">Dogo Argentino</a></b>, and the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fila_Brasileiro">Fila Brasileiro</a></b>. This act makes it illegal to own certain dogs without a court exemption; it also bans the breeding, exchange and sale of the specified dogs even if they have been granted an exemption in court.
To be found exempt, a dog's owner must prove to the court that the dog is not a danger to public safety, is neutered and microchipped, and that the owner is 'fit and proper' to be in charge of the dog. Once exempt, the dog must be muzzled and kept on a lead in any public places, the owner must keep the dog at the address listed, and the owner must notify the court of the death or export of the dog. They must also notify the court if their address changes. If a dog is not found exempt, it may receive a 'destruction order' meaning it is scheduled to be put down and the owner may face criminal charges. The act has been criticised in the past for being 'rushed' and for a lack of scientific evidence to support that all dogs of a certain breed are dangerous.

 There are also many other laws pertaining to the ownership of dogs as pets - for example, there is the <b><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Welfare_Act_2006>Animal Welfare Act</a></b> passed in 2006. This act lists the responsibilities of an owner such as the five 'welfare needs' - the need for a suitable environment, the need for a suitable diet, the need to be able to exhibit normal behaviour, the need to be housed with (or apart from depending on the requirements of the pet) other animals and the need to be protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease.
 This act also includes a section encompassing the responsibilities of an owner in regards to prevention of harm, banning such things as tail docking (for cosmetic reasons; exemptions can be made for working dogs) and animal fighting.
 The act also states that the national authority can make regulations regarding the licence and registration of animals.

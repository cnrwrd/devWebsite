     Everything evolves from something, dogs included; it is believed that domestic dogs actually share genetic lineage with wolves. Genetic studies show that the ancestor of the pet dog may be an extinct type of wolf known as the <b><a class = "active" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megafaunal_wolf>Late Pleistocene wolf</a></b>. It is believed that the divergence between dogs and wolves came between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago. However, genetic studies also show that the modern wolf is not genetically close to our domesticated dogs as a result of the genetic divergence. The first undisputed remains of a dog recorded is the remains of the <b><a class = "active" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_domestic_dog#Bonn-Oberkassel_dog>Bonn-Oberkassel dog</a></b> which was buried beside humans 14,200 years ago and found in 1914.

    The first domestic dogs were believed to have been used for assistance in hunting; this belief was founded with the discovery of petroglyph rock art dating to 8000 <abbr title ="years before present">YBP</abbr>.
    From this, due to selective breeding dogs evolved for different purposes and types of work; dogs are actually the most variable mammal on Earth with around 450 globally recognised dog breeds. It is also due to selective breeding that we have dogs as pets; humans specifically chose to breed dogs to create newer breeds that were more aesthetically pleasing and easily domesticated. In the modern day, according to data, dogs are the most popular pet owned globally. In the United States alone, it is estimated that there are over 73 million pet dogs.

    Throughout history, dogs have been depicted as having a partnership with humans; murals from Ancient Egypt show pharaohs keeping dogs as companions. In China, dogs belonging to Chinese emperors were said to have had human wet nurses for the pups. However it is believed that in Europe, dogs being kept as pets only gained popularity between the 13th and 15th centuries, when nobility and aristocracy kept them.
